# AirPlayPC

Mirror an iPhone screen to a Windows or Arch Linux PC using **native iOS Screen
Mirroring** — no app on the phone.

The phone sees the PC in Control Center → Screen Mirroring, exactly like an
Apple TV. Nothing to install on iOS, nothing to sideload.

> ✅ **Verified end to end** (2026-07-20): an iPhone on the home Wi-Fi found the
> PC in Screen Mirroring and completed a full mirroring session, no cable. See
> [Status](#status).

## How it works

This repo is **desktop integration, not protocol code**. The receiver itself is
[UxPlay](https://github.com/FDH2/UxPlay) (native UxPlay on Arch, or the prebuilt
[uxplay-windows](https://github.com/leapbtw/uxplay-windows) build on Windows), which
implements the hard parts: mDNS advertisement, RTSP, the FairPlay handshake,
pair-verify, and H.264 over RTP.

What's added here is the part that's otherwise fiddly and badly documented:
install, firewall rules, mDNS prerequisites, low-latency defaults, and a
diagnostic script that names the actual cause when it doesn't work.

## Platform support

| Platform | Engine | Controller | Setup and diagnostics |
|---|---|---|---|
| Arch Linux / derivatives | Native UxPlay 1.73.x | GTK 4 + CLI | pacman/AUR/source fallback; firewalld/UFW |
| Windows 10/11 | uxplay-windows 1.72.1-3 | WPF + CLI | Inno Setup; Windows Firewall |

### Arch Linux requirements

- Arch Linux or an Arch derivative using pacman.
- A normal graphical X11 or Wayland session. Mirroring and fullscreen work on
  both. The optional phone-shaped frame is X11-only because Wayland prevents
  one application from reading and positioning itself around another
  application's window.
- The PC and iPhone must be on the same local network/broadcast domain.
- Optional control requires a Bluetooth LE adapter that supports peripheral
  advertising. The installer enables BlueZ and installs the pinned HID helper.

### Windows requirements

- Windows 10/11, Windows PowerShell 5.1 (the built-in one — PowerShell 7 not needed).
- **Apple Bonjour.** UxPlay 1.72 imports `dnssd.dll` and calls `DNSServiceRegister`
  to advertise itself, so without Bonjour the receiver runs but never appears on
  the phone. iTunes installs it; otherwise get
  [Bonjour Print Services for Windows](https://support.apple.com/kb/DL999).
  `setup.ps1` checks for it and stops if it's missing.

## Install on Arch Linux

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gbulog/pcairplay.git
cd pcairplay

# Preview package, service, firewall, and user-integration changes:
./setup.sh --dry-run

# Install. This uses a configured uxplay package, then paru/yay, then a pinned
# auditable source build if no package or AUR helper is available.
./setup.sh

# Verify the complete local setup, optionally including the iPhone address:
./doctor.sh
./doctor.sh --phone-ip 192.168.1.42

# Start from the terminal, or launch AirPlayPC from the desktop application menu:
./start-airplay.sh
./AirPlayPC.sh
```

The setup installs the required GStreamer plugins, UxPlay, user-local launchers,
desktop entries, and a user systemd unit. If firewalld or UFW is active, it opens
UDP 5353 and TCP/UDP 7000–7002. The receiver uses those fixed ports by default;
this avoids Linux firewall rules that appear correct but do not cover UxPlay's
otherwise-random ports.

To run it whenever your user session starts:

```bash
systemctl --user enable --now pcairplay.service
```

To remove the integration and firewall rules later (UxPlay, settings, pairing
data, and logs are deliberately retained):

```bash
./setup.sh --uninstall
```

Arch CLI options use GNU-style names:

```bash
./start-airplay.sh --name "Demo Screen" --fullscreen
./start-airplay.sh --sync                 # correct lip-sync for video
./start-airplay.sh --fps 30               # reduce network load
./start-airplay.sh --pin                  # require a PIN
./start-airplay.sh --share-safe           # capture-friendly OpenGL sink
./start-airplay.sh --software-decode
./start-airplay.sh --no-audio
./start-airplay.sh --dry-run              # inspect exact UxPlay argv
```

Arch logs live in `${XDG_STATE_HOME:-~/.local/state}/pcairplay/`; settings live
in `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-~/.config}/pcairplay/`. The latest five logs for each
launcher are retained.

### Control the mirrored iPhone on Arch

AirPlay itself only sends the picture. The Arch port can additionally present
the laptop as a Bluetooth mouse and keyboard, which iOS accepts through
AssistiveTouch:

```bash
./AirPlayPC-Control.sh
# or, after setup:
pcairplay-control
```

You can also click **Mirror & Control** in the main AirPlayPC window. The
combined window renders the live 1080p H.264 mirror on the left and keeps its
touchpad and keyboard on the right, including on Wayland. Click **Start mirror
here**; it starts both the embedded receiver and Bluetooth input. Then on the
iPhone open **Settings → Accessibility →
Touch → AssistiveTouch**, turn it on, and choose **Devices → Bluetooth Devices →
AirPlayPC Input**. The live video is itself an absolute control surface with a
cursor overlay that remains visible in window shares. The controller also
provides a relative touchpad, click/drag/scroll,
horizontal two-finger home-screen paging, mappable AssistiveTouch Home/App
Switcher/Spotlight buttons, and US-keyboard text entry. Click a text field in
the embedded phone screen and continue typing directly on the PC keyboard, or
use the text proxy on the right. Keeping Full Keyboard Access off provides the
least surprising typing behavior because that separate iOS accessibility mode
reserves several hardware-keyboard shortcuts.
For text editing, **Hold / Select** keeps the primary pointer button down while
you move across the video; Select All, Copy, and Paste emit their standard
hardware-keyboard shortcuts. Submitted text stays in the local field until
focus leaves it.

The three system-action buttons are intentionally normal HID pointer buttons;
iOS does not accept a generic third-party “Home” command. In **AssistiveTouch →
Devices → AirPlayPC Input → Customize Additional Buttons**, press each desktop
button when prompted and assign Button 2 to Home, Button 3 to App Switcher, and
Button 4 to Spotlight. If the phone was paired to an earlier build, forget and
re-pair AirPlayPC Input first so iOS refreshes the HID descriptor.

AirPlayPC provides its own BlueZ pairing agent, so this works without a desktop
Bluetooth applet. Only start Bluetooth input when you intend to pair. HID bonds
are encrypted, but Bluetooth Just Works pairing has no man-in-the-middle
verification, so a nearby device could pair during that window. As soon as the
iPhone subscribes, AirPlayPC closes discoverable and pairable mode; exiting
control restores the adapter's previous settings. Control reports are emitted
only after a client subscribes, and the GTK window captures input only while it
is focused. UxPlay 1.73 or newer with `-scrsv` and `-vrtp` support is required
for the Arch application; startup and `doctor` report an actionable error for
older or incompatible builds.

This is an AssistiveTouch input device paired with a separate AirPlay video
stream, not Apple's authenticated iPhone Mirroring protocol. The iPhone must
remain unlocked and visible; Face ID, protected lock-screen entry, camera,
microphone, clipboard integration, and true multitouch are not available.
Apple documents the same Bluetooth pointer-device pairing path in its
[AssistiveTouch guide](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/111775).

## Install on Windows

### Option A — installer (recommended)

Download **`AirPlayPC-setup-<version>.exe`** from the
[latest release](https://github.com/gbulog/pcairplay/releases/latest) and run
it. It installs the scripts plus Start Menu shortcuts (**AirPlayPC**,
**AirPlayPC Diagnostics**), then offers to run first-time setup — which
downloads the UxPlay engine (pinned 1.72.1-3, SHA-256-checked against the
upstream release) and opens the firewall. If Apple Bonjour is missing, setup
says so and points at Apple's own installer — see *Requirements* above.

Your browser may flag the download itself (Edge: "…isn't commonly
downloaded") — that is reputation for a new unsigned exe, not a detection.
In Edge: hover the download → **⋯ → Keep → Show more → Keep anyway**. Windows
SmartScreen may then warn once more when you run it ("Windows protected your
PC") — click **More info → Run anyway**, or verify the download against
`SHA256SUMS.txt` on the release page first. The exe contains
only the scripts in this repo; the engine comes from
[uxplay-windows](https://github.com/leapbtw/uxplay-windows)'s own release at
install time.

To remove it later: **Settings → Apps → AirPlayPC**. The uninstaller also
removes the firewall rules; UxPlay and Bonjour keep their own Apps & Features
entries.

### Option B — ZIP / clone

```powershell
# If you downloaded a ZIP rather than cloning, unblock the files first:
Get-ChildItem *.ps1, *.cmd | Unblock-File

# 1. Elevated PowerShell, in this directory:
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\setup.ps1

# 2. Verify (double-click "Diagnostics.cmd", or):
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\doctor.ps1

# 3. Start the receiver — either one:
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\start-airplay.ps1
#   ...or just double-click "AirPlayPC.vbs" for the desktop UI
#   ("AirPlayPC.cmd" does the same; the .vbs opens with zero window flashes)
```

Undo it all later with `setup.ps1 -Uninstall` (removes the firewall rules and
nothing else).

Then on the iPhone: **Control Center → Screen Mirroring → pick the PC**.

> **Which UxPlay build?** `setup.ps1` deliberately installs **1.72.1-3**, not the
> latest release. UxPlay 2.x is a Qt6 rewrite that links uxplay in as a library
> and ships **no `uxplay.exe` and no command line** — verified by reading the
> published 2.0.0.1736 archive. These scripts drive the engine by command line,
> so 2.x cannot be used here and `setup.ps1` refuses it. See
> [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md#the-1x--2x-split--read-this-before-touching-setupps1).

## The Windows UI

`airplay-ui.ps1` is a self-contained WPF app over the same engine — device name,
latency mode, resolution and framerate, fullscreen, the iPhone-style frame,
share-safe video and PIN, one Start/Stop button, and a shortcut to the
diagnostics. Double-click **`AirPlayPC.vbs`** to launch it — nothing else
appears: no console windows, no taskbar blips, not even while the engine runs
(it lives in a hidden console the UI manages).

The **iPhone frame** switch wraps the live mirror in a phone-shaped chassis —
bezel, rounded corners, side buttons (`frame-mirror.ps1` doing the work). The
frame opens with the UI, remembers its position and size, and the switch works
mid-session in both directions. **Closing the UI closes everything**: receiver,
engine, frame — one predictable rule, nothing left behind.

**Fullscreen** and the frame are mutually exclusive — fullscreen fills the
monitor with the video itself, so there is nothing for a chassis to wrap;
switching either one on switches the other off.

Settings persist across launches (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\pcairplay\ui-settings.json`).
With **Require PIN** on, the 4-digit code appears right in the window under the
status and stays there for the whole session, including while mirroring — the
UI generates it and hands it to the engine, so there is no console to go read.
The UI is single-instance: launching it twice just surfaces the window that is
already open.

The status it shows is **"Discoverable" / "iPhone connected" / "Mirroring"**,
derived from the engine's actual sockets and log — it names the documented
"connected but no video" stall too, with the phone-side reset that clears it.

While the receiver is live the settings visibly recede and lock (the frame
switch stays live on purpose). `airplay-ui.ps1 -SelfTest` builds the whole
window, asserts its layout geometry and the exact engine command line, and
exits — run it after any edit there.

It also detects **competing AirPlay receivers** (PigeonCast, AirServer,
Reflector, a stale `uxplay`) and offers to close them. This matters: a second
receiver holds port 7000 *and* advertises a second entry in the iPhone's
mirroring list, so it's easy to pick the wrong one.

## Windows usage

```powershell
.\start-airplay.ps1                              # low-latency defaults
.\start-airplay.ps1 -Name "Demo Screen"          # rename as shown on the phone
.\start-airplay.ps1 -Fullscreen
.\start-airplay.ps1 -Sync                        # correct lip-sync, for video
.\start-airplay.ps1 -Fps 30                      # if the network stutters
.\start-airplay.ps1 -Pin                         # require a PIN to connect
.\start-airplay.ps1 -NoLog                       # don't write a log this run
```

Both launchers write logs to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\pcairplay\`, keeping the last five
runs. This is on by default — if mirroring misbehaves, that directory is the
first thing to look at, and the first thing to send.

Defaults are tuned for **demos and app screen-sharing** — responsiveness over
perfect A/V sync. Use `-Sync` when watching video, where lip-sync matters more
than latency.

## Troubleshooting on Windows

Run `.\doctor.ps1 -PhoneIP <iphone-ip>` first. It checks, in the order these
actually bite:

1. **Windows Firewall / Public network profile** — blocks inbound mDNS, so the
   PC never appears in the list. Fix: `setup.ps1 -SetNetworkPrivate`.
2. **AP / client isolation on the router** — blocks Wi-Fi clients from reaching
   wired devices. Common on guest SSIDs, and the classic killer of the
   wired-PC / Wi-Fi-phone setup.
3. **Phone on a different subnet or guest SSID** — mDNS doesn't route across
   subnets.
4. **Extra network adapters** (VPN, Hyper-V) making mDNS advertise the wrong IP.
5. **A third-party firewall** (ESET, Kaspersky, Bitdefender) with its own rules,
   independent of Windows Firewall. Every Windows check passes and the PC still
   never appears.
6. **A competing AirPlay receiver** already running and advertising.

Get the iPhone's IP from Settings → Wi-Fi → tap ⓘ next to the network.

### The phone can't join the PC's network (guest Wi-Fi)

If the iPhone is stuck on a guest SSID — client isolation, separate subnet — no
setting on the PC can bridge that. mDNS does not cross subnets.

**Use USB instead.** Personal Hotspot over a USB cable puts the phone and the PC
on one direct link and bypasses the router entirely:

1. Install **Apple Devices** from the Microsoft Store (this supplies the USB
   network driver).
2. Connect the iPhone by USB, unlock it, tap **Trust This Computer**.
3. iPhone → **Settings → Personal Hotspot → Allow Others to Join → ON**.
4. `.\doctor.ps1` — check 8 should now report the tether link as **Up**.
5. Start the receiver and mirror as usual.

This uses cellular data only for internet; the mirroring traffic stays on the
USB link, which is faster and more stable than Wi-Fi.

## Privacy notes

- Mirroring is a copy of the phone screen, so **incoming notifications appear
  in the mirror** — and to everyone watching it. Turn on a Focus / Do Not
  Disturb mode on the iPhone before presenting to a room or a call.
- **Require PIN** (the UI switch, or `-Pin` on the CLI) stops anyone else on
  the network from mirroring to your PC unchallenged.
- Nothing here phones home: no telemetry, no accounts. Logs and settings stay
  in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\pcairplay` on your machine.

## iOS compatibility

Open-source receivers work by making iOS fall back to the **"Legacy Protocol"**
built for the 3rd-gen Apple TV. No open-source project implements modern
AirPlay 2 mirroring.

| iOS | Status |
|---|---|
| 17 | ✅ Confirmed working |
| 18 | ✅ Working |
| 26 | ✅ Working |
| 27 | ⚠️ **At risk** — [UxPlay #535](https://github.com/FDH2/UxPlay/issues/535), unresolved |

On iOS 27 the phone appears to connect but never opens the data connection, so
no video arrives. If `doctor.ps1` passes every check and mirroring still fails
this way, check the iOS version — it may be an upstream protocol break rather
than anything local.

**Apple-DRM content (Apple TV+, Netflix) will not mirror** to any open-source
receiver. This is by design and can't be worked around.

## Ports

On Arch, AirPlayPC defaults to the consecutive range **7000–7002 for both TCP
and UDP**, plus UDP 5353 for mDNS. Those are the rules created for firewalld or
UFW. `--dynamic-ports` removes the fixed UxPlay `-p` option; use it only when no
host firewall is filtering inbound traffic. `--legacy-ports` uses UxPlay's
non-consecutive legacy set instead and requires matching manual firewall rules.

The Windows firewall setup covers the following ranges:

| Port | Proto | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| 7000, 7001, 7100 | TCP | AirPlay control / RTSP / mirroring |
| 6000–6009 | UDP | RTP video, audio, timing |
| 5353 | UDP | mDNS discovery |

> **These are the ports the firewall rules cover, not the ports normally used.**
> Started without `-Port`, UxPlay lets the OS pick an *ephemeral* TCP port and
> publishes it via mDNS, so the fixed rules above cover nothing in normal
> operation. The program-scoped rule `PCAirPlay - uxplay.exe (any port)` created
> by `setup.ps1` is what actually permits inbound traffic — if the PC appears on
> the phone but never connects, check that rule first. Pass `-Port 7000` to force
> the fixed ports.

## Status

**Verified** on two Windows 11 PCs against UxPlay 1.72.1-3: full mirroring
sessions over home Wi-Fi and over USB tether (iPhone on iOS 26.5.2), hardware
H.264 decode active (`d3d11h264dec`), every tuned flag checked against
`uxplay -h`. `doctor.ps1`, `setup.ps1 -WhatIf`, `start-airplay.ps1 -DryRun` and
both `-SelfTest`s run clean end to end, and the UI and CLI produce identical
engine arguments for the same settings.

The Arch port is compile- and parser-tested against native upstream UxPlay
1.74, with headless self-tests for shared argv construction, the GTK controller,
and the frame geometry. Live discovery and mirroring still require a real LAN,
graphical session, and iPhone; run `./doctor.sh` on the target Arch host before
the first session.

**CI**: every push runs the real `setup.ps1` flow on a clean GitHub runner —
upstream release lookup, download, SHA-256 verification, silent install,
firewall create and `-Uninstall` teardown — plus both `-SelfTest`s, the CLI
`-DryRun`, and a compile of the installer.

See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for the full breakdown, the first-run checklist, and
several gotchas found the hard way.

## Licence

MIT — see [LICENSE](LICENSE). This covers the scripts in this repo only.

It installs **UxPlay, which is GPL-3.0** and vendors a reverse-engineered
FairPlay implementation. Fine for personal use; worth understanding before
redistributing any bundle — which is why the installer here downloads UxPlay
from its own upstream release at install time instead of bundling it, and
ships nothing of Apple's.
